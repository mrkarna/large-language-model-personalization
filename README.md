Recently we have seen a lot of advancements in the field of Large Language Models (LLM). LLMs, for example, ChatGPT by OpenAI, are getting used for a variety of use cases including question-answer generation, paraphrasing, coding, etc. However, the content generated by these LLMs is not user-specific. Or to say, they don’t provide personalized responses. This paper focuses on the personalization of the Large Language Model. We particularly use a data set by LaMP called LaMP-3U consisting of product ratings given by users and try to personalize the ratings based on the user’s experience. We propose a clustering-based approach to target the problem and compare our results with the benchmark set by the LaMP paper.
